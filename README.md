Given a sorted array in which all elements appear twice (one after one) and one element
appears only once. Itâ€™s required to find this element (i.e. element that appears once)
Design an efficient algorithm that you can use for solving this problem.

Input: Already Implemented
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 30), that indicates the number of test cases. Each
case consists of array items
Output: Already Implemented
A single integer that represents the element that appears once in the given array.

Function: Implement it!
 public static int FindUniqueElement(int[] arr, int N)

It takes one sorted array (which all elements appear twice except one), it shall return the
unique element in arr.
ElementOnceAppearence.cs includes this method.
